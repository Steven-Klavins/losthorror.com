# What is losthorror.com?

losthorror.com is a WordPress site I'm currently building to blog and document horror movies that may have fallen into obscurity by now. I'm creating this site in order to shine some light on the often forgotten horror movies of the past. If you're a fan of horror effects, the video nasties, movie history, or just simply like a good scare this will be the site for you!
